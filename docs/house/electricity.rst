Electricity
===========

Using wood is actually not that green as it releases CO2 and small particles that are harmful
to humans.

* 830 kWh of electricity per month

Setup
~~~~~

You will probably not be able to generate enough for your peak consumption at all times.
To meet your consumption all generation methods will require you to store the energy
in batteries for later usage.


* Electricity generator
* Regulator
* Batteries
* `DC-AC inverter 
* Gas Generator for backup/emergency

Energy Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solar Panels
------------

* photovoltaic
* needs storage for off hours
* little moving parts

* photovoltaic solar panels
* inverter
* batteries

Hydro Electricity
-----------------

* very consistent
* less batteries
* requires a source of running water

Wind Power
----------

* 5 to 15 kW is required, rotor of 23 feet in diameter, mounted on a tower 100+ feet tall
* needs storage for off hours
* more moving parts: more maintenance

Refresher
~~~~~~~~~

* Connecting batteries in series will increase the voltage, i.e 2 batteries of 12V will be able to deliver 24V.
To charge the system you will need to match the same voltage i.e 24V in the example.
To avoid batteries charging differently each batteries should be charged individually.

* connecting batteries in parallel will increase the current and will keep the voltage. i.e 2 batteries of 200 Ah will be able 
to deliver 400 Ah. Such setting will increase the duration electrical equipement can be powered for.
But it will take longer to charge them all.

* Watt = Volt * Amp
